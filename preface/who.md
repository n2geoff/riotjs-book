# Who Is This Book Written For

While it might be selfish to say, I wrote it for myself.  Hold on, let me explain.  When new technology comes out development teams and companies are often resistant to adopting them.  The key components to adopting new technology is usually hinged a few things

- Active Development
- Support
- Community

Community usually includes things like support forums, documentation, tutorials, training videos/programs, books, ect...

As of writting this book, no book existed, however there is a plethra of great content around RiotJS, from thier own awesome documentation, to video training on YouTube, Egghead, UDemy and a growing community of RiotJS enthusiests 


## But who really is the book written for

This book is written for the developer that wants to build more with less.  The developer who believes in small components composed together to build grand things. The developer that loves the core web stack (html, css, javascript) as it is both today, and where they are going to be in the future.  Those developers that want compliment the web stack with templates written in `html`, styles in `css`, and logic in JavaScript.  
This book is for you.
